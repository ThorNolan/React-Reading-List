## 🔑 How to Use the App:



## 📁 Deployment Instructions

Deployed version of the app can be found [here](DEPLOYED LINK HERE). To run this app on your machine, follow these instructions. Further options for running the app yourself can also be found in the ReadMe under the my-app section. 

1. Clone this repository down to your machine.
   
2. You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in order to continue. 
   
3. Enter `npm install` in your command line after navigating into the root directory, which will install the dependencies listed in the package.json.
   
4. Enter `node server.js`, which will initiate the server on http://localhost:3306.
   
5. Navigate to http://localhost:3306 in your browser, or ctrl-click the link that will be logged to your console. Enjoy!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
